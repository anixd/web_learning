<p> <b>Sheep are related to antelopes, cattle, muskoxen and goats. All of these mammals are even-toed ungulates — their hooves are cloven, or split into two toes. They are also ruminants — their stomachs have
     multiple chambers to aid digestion. Most sheep have large, curling horns that are made of keratin — the same stuff as fingernails.</b></p>

<p><em>Most people are familiar with sheep as wooly farm animals that say "Baa." But the domestic sheep is just one species of sheep. There are also five (or six, depending on the source) species of wild sheep.  
Size & description
According to Susan Schoenian, a sheep and goat specialist at the University of Maryland's Western Maryland Research & Education Center, it is estimated that there are more than 10,000 distinct breeds of
 domestic sheep (Ovis aries) worldwide, so they are diverse in size. Selective breeding has produced sheep with or without horns, wool and external ears, according to the University of Michigan's Animal
  Diversity Web (ADW). They range in length from 4 to 6 feet (120 to 180 cm) and from 2 to 4 feet (65 to 127 cm) at the shoulder. Habitat
  Sheep were among the first animals to be domesticated, and they are raised all over the world. Wild sheep also live throughout the world — in the Middle East, Asia, Central Europe and North America — mostly 
  in mountainous areas. Bighorn sheep live in the Rocky Mountain region of North America. Desert bighorn sheep live in Death Valley, California, as well as Nevada, Texas and northern Mexico. They can live on desert 
  mountains as high as 4,000 feet (1,200 m). Urials can live even higher up. They are found in Asia and the Middle East on grassy terrains with elevations of up to 19,690 feet (6,000 m), according to the ADW. 
  Habits</em></p>
<p><strong> Are social, but usually only with their own gender. Males have their own herds called bachelor herds. These herds usually contain five to 50 rams at one time. The females live in nursery herds. Nursery herds can have five 
to 100 members that include adult females and their young.</strong> </p>

<p>Male sheep fight for dominance in their group. Some ram each other at speeds up to 20 mph (32 kph), according to National Geographic(opens in new tab). Dominance is gained when one male submits. This process can take hours.
Offspring
Male sheep fight for the right to mate with the females and the strongest is usually the only one allowed to mate. Mating season, called the rut, happens in the autumn. After mating, female sheep have a gestation period of around 
five months. They usually give birth to one or two offspring at a time in the spring. 

Baby sheep are called lambs. Lambs can walk just minutes after they are born, though they are often dependent on their mothers for the first four to six months of their lives. They are weaned around four to six month and become 
sexually mature around one and a half to five years, depending on species and gender. For example, the male argali sheep doesn’t become sexually mature until age 5, while the female becomes sexually mature at age 1 or 2, according to the ADW. </p>
